## Recipe API

### Description
This was my final project for Software Integration, Configuration, and Testing CEN-4802C for Fall 2024. The purpose of this project is to implement an API for a recipe application utilizing MySQL. This project is meant to display a CI/CD workflow using Maven, Jenkins, and Docker. JUnit5 was implemented for unit testing. JMeter tests were included for performance and stress testing. Logging is implemented in a JSON format. Docker Compose is used for containerization of a MySQL server and the application for testing.
